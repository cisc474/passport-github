# passport-github

GitHub authentication strategy for Passport and Node.js.

### Rather than muck around with oAuth from scratch I used passport js.  The example was outdated (working from express 3).
### So it's been updated to express 4.

    npm install

### You'll need to create a github application and replace the data in the app.
